# Neural_Network_From_Scratch
This repository contains a simple implementation of a neural network from scratch using Python. It includes classes for neurons, layers, and a neural network itself, demonstrating forward and backward propagation for training. Ideal for learning the fundamentals of neural networks and machine learning concepts.
